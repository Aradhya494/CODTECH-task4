### Objective
Here the objective  is to create a program in C that can make text smaller by compressing it. It should find repeated letters or patterns and shorten them. For example, instead of writing "aaaaa", the program can write "a5".

### Key Activities
 1.Working with strings
   – Use arrays, loops, and string handling functions to process text.
   
 2.electing a compression method
   – Choose a basic algorithm like Run-Length Encoding (RLE). 

### Technologies Used
**C Programming Language**
  – Core language used to write the compression tool.

**Standard C Libraries**
  – Libraries like stdio.h and string.h used for input/output and string manipulation.

**Text Editor** 
  – Tools like Code:: VS Code.

### Key Insight
The main insight  is that data can often be reduced in size by identifying patterns or repetitions — like repeated characters — and replacing them with shorter representations.
